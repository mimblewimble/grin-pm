## Status after the period

### Inaccessible funds

Due to [Ignotus absence](https://forum.grin.mw/t/on-ignos-absence/5301) in this period, the project has lost access to the GRIN, ETH, and ZEC wallet addresses, which contained the following balances by the end of the period:

Currency | Amount | Wallet address(es)
|---|---:|---|
GRIN | 7120.367203 | https://donations.grin-tech.org
ZEC | 5.8 | t1QGYYXan3HHEuiPEfccKnUuWEP4CsVvPA5

We expect these funds to be unavailable temporarily and recoverable once Ignotus returns. There is also a risk that the funds could be lost permanently.

| | | | $828,991.74 |

### Comments
* Beneficial movements in the BTC exchange rate during the period.
* As per above, some funds remain inaccessible.
* Majority of increase in funds is derived from a single 50 BTC donation in the period.
