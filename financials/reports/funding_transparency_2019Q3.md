### Inaccessible funds

Due to [Ignotus absence](https://forum.grin.mw/t/on-ignos-absence/5301) as first reported in the [2019Q2 report](funding_transparency_2019Q2.md), the project has lost access to GRIN, ETH, and ZEC wallet addresses, which contained the following balances:

|---|---:|---:|---:|
GRIN | 3156 | | |
BTC | 2.98 | 0.00008141 | 2.98008141 |


### Comments
* A new GRIN donation address, `https://council-donations.yeastplume.org` was set up in the period, managed by yeastplume, but with the seed backed up for redundancy. All according to relevant [governance meeting decision](../../notes/20190730-meeting-governance.md#decision-grineth-donation-setup). So far, no ETH donation or ZEC donation addresses have been set up.
* Majority of GRIN received in the period (3,125) stemmed from a donation by SparkPool.
* Majority of BTC received in the period (1.11) stemmed from monthly donations by Poloniex.
* All spend in the period, both GRIN & BTC, was done as [donation to Yeastplume for their work on the project](../../notes/20190827-meeting-governance.md#31-decision-yeastplume-request-for-funding).

## Status after the period

### Disposable funds

At the end of Sep 30 2019, Grin held disposable funds to the equivalent of $620,477.83 in the following assets:

Currency | Amount | USD x-rate Sep 30 2019 | USD Equivalent | Wallet address(es)
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
GRIN | 0.7 | $1.38 | $0.97 | `https://donations.grin-tech.org`
BTC | 74.81145066 | $8,293.87 | $620,476.45 | 3ChVP627KU5w4zu2rieFPF3wGXWQgmhvrs <br />bc1qdgs8vkpzr256qjlzlfht72z3mhcrdrt6wj2rfjw39j8us24gz8uq78qj65
| | | | $620,477.83 |

### Inaccessible funds
Having had no news from Ignotus during the quarter, we no longer expect these funds to be recoverable, and instead consider them lost permanently. There possibility of course remains that Ignotus returns to the project, which could lead to these funds being recovered. In that case it will be considered new income at the time.

Currency | Amount | Wallet address(es)
|---|---:|---|
GRIN | 7120.367203 | `https://donations.grin-tech.org`
ZEC | 5.8 | t1QGYYXan3HHEuiPEfccKnUuWEP4CsVvPA5
ETH | 1.742385670725710718 | 0x16726940eCEBdfb3c352C29bF2620f59EF919a3b

### Comments
* The biggest reason for the drop in disposable funds was due to the negative movements in the USD/BTC exchange rate during the period.
* Nevertheless, in the period, Grin spent roughly the equivalent of twice the amount of funds that were received by donations. 
* As per above, the inaccessible funds are now considered lost. Measures have been taken to reduce the risk of this happening again to the project.
* It was generally considered a quarter of low activity, both in terms of income and spending.
