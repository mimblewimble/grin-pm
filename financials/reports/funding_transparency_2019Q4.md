### Comments
* In addition to the above, the core team moved all BTC funds into new mu-sig wallet addresses, and there are consolidation transactions that occured as part of this. See the relevant pull requests for more details: 
   * https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-pm/pull/217
   * https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-pm/pull/222 
* Majority of BTC received in the period (~50) stemmed from another [coinbase donation from an anonymous source](https://forum.grin.mw/t/donation-to-the-grin-general-fund-nov-11/6446).
* In addition, QTUM donated the equivalent of $15,000 in BTC to be headline sponsor of grincon1.
* Majority of GRIN received in the period (4100) stemmed from Sparkpool sponsorship of grincon1.
* All BTC spend in the period (~0.88) went to a [donation to Lehnberg for their work on the project](../../notes/20191008-meeting-governance.md#7-decision-approve-lehnberg-request-for-funding).
* All GRIN spend in the period (~1000) went to Tromp for making a 1024 EUR donation to grincon venue [c-base](https://c-base.org).
* EDIT Mar 08 2021: A BTC 0.01744541 discrepancy spend was added which was uncovered only now, likely due to historical ways of how we accounted for outputs. This equates to roughly USD 125 at the exchange rate at the time, and USD 900 at present day.

## Status after the period

### Disposable funds

At the end of Dec 31 2019, Grin held disposable funds to the equivalent of $911,420.70 in the following assets:

Currency | Amount | USD x-rate Dec 31 2019 | USD Equivalent | Wallet address(es)

| | | | $911,420.70 |

### Comments
* The disposable funds at the end of the final quarter of 2019 increased substantially in large thanks to the second coinbase donation received by the project. 
* The negative movements in the USD/BTC and USD/GRIN exchange rate during the period decreased the dollar equivalent values of disposable funds.
* EDIT Mar 08 2021: A BTC 0.01744541 discrepancy spend was added which was uncovered only now, likely due to historical ways of how we accounted for outputs. This equates to roughly USD 125 at the exchange rate at the time, and USD 900 at present day.
