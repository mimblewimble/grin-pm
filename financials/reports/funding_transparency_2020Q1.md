### Comments
* Quarter over Quarter, the disposable funds decreased by ~ $157,000.
* Spending on funding requests accounted for, in Mar 31 exchange rates, approximately ~$60,000 of this decrease.
* The rest of the decline is attributed to the negative moments in the USD/BTC and USD/GRIN exchange rates during the period, which decreased the dollar equivalent values of disposable funds.
