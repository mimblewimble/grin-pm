## Agenda points & Actions

### 1. Agenda review
[Proposed agenda](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-pm/issues/66) accepted.

### 2. Action point follow ups from previous meetings

[Previous actions](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-pm/blob/master/notes/20190212-meeting-governance.md):

* Fund spending transparency report not created yet, no spends yet.

### 3. [Security audits](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/issues/1609)
* **ignopeverell:** Catheryne has sent me a contract yesterday that I need to review. We'll have to pay 1/3 of the total amount up front, the rest to come at the end. Hopefully we'll have this set up this week.

### 4. Promotion of other projects

* No new proposals yet. 
* Hall of fame proposal is [in process of being implemented](https://nijynot.github.io/site/friends) by @nijynot.

### 5. Risk mgmt brainstorm

* _ignopeverell:_ I don't think there's been any more progress, which is likely partly my fault as I haven't replied yet to setup the first interview. Hopefully I can get back to that this week as well.
* _tromp:_ I did one interview on risk, then suggested to bring in Yeastplume on another (more wallet focussed).

### 6. Marketing/Media/PR releations
* Previous write-up by @lehnberg:
   > Regarding PR, I'd say no pr@ centralization / gatekeeping, although I really appreciate the help we’ve been offered. But as I told the owner of the PR company in person, part of what makes Grin “Grin” is that we're community driven and non-hierarchical. It sends a strange message in my opinion when a community project has a PR agency co-ordinating interview requests. I think we've been doing okay managing PR, media and positioning so far, with an irreverent underdog attitude that journalists seem to like and doesn’t come off as try-hard. We’re earnest, and in my opinion do not struggle to receive accurate news coverage. It feels more something like an ICO project, a foundation, or a VC company would need rather than an open source project. /my two cents.
* _noble_block_twitter:_ Sounds like coordinating media interviews is not really a want/need at the moment. I'll still support the project in whatever way I can, and will  leave the door open if this ever becomes a headache. In the meanwhile, should I just point to gitter to coordinate if I have someone come asking?
* _ignopeverell:_ I think that's a good assumption.

### 7. Gary Yuu proposal to hire developers

* _garyyu:_ I propose to offer Igno and Antioch full-time jobs for Grin development.
   * [Full proposal](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-pm/issues/66#issuecomment-466845227)
   * I strongly prefer this to be "full time jobs" rather than "time based" or "tasked based" as @lehnberg had previously suggested. If the offer is not a stable and long-term job, it's difficult for part of us to make that hard decision to quit the current day job!
* _yeastplume:_ Given the cash flow situation (or lack of one) there's no way grin can offer a full time job to anyone. The money isn't there, and there's no point pretending to anyone that we can give them a stable and secure job. It's much safer all around to consider chunks of work for an amount of time. More like a contract from the dev's perspective. 
   * _hashmap:_ specific chunks of work or chunks of times? I’m more inclined towards the later. Full time job sounds unrealistic atm, time-limited contracts is closer to reality.
   * _igno:_ same
   * _quentinlesceller:_ same
   * _kargakis:_ time sounds better
   * _jaspervdm:_ offering a long term job also comes with some centralization risk
* _yeastplume:_ I think 3-6 months is good, as long as the money is there. I did 6 for the last campaign to avoid having to go back into fundraising too soon, but 3 month chunks is probably appropriate if there is some inwards cash flow (even if it's unreliable). I've done 3 months stints a few times with 4 kids and a mortgage and payments. It's risky employment.
* _ignopeverell:_ I would personally favor starting with a 3 months donation for @antiochp and go from there, once we're happy with that we can start looking at other candidates like myself depending on funds.
   * so the first proposal to be voted on would be: donation from the general fund to @antiochp for 3 months of work at $10k/month.
   * _antiochp:_ Most if not all of that time would be presumably working on dandelion and relative lock times and other features as deemed fit by the council.
   * _The meeting agreed unaninmously, aside from one dissenter (@miketwenty_twitter) who had no substantial reason for disagreeing._

#### Decision: Funding for Antioch Peverell
Donation of $30k to Antioch Peverell (@antiochp) from the main dev fund, to facilitate Antioch working full time on Grin protocol development as they see fit for a period of 3 months.

### 10. Other questions

None

**Meeting adjourned.**
