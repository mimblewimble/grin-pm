## Agenda points & Actions
### 1. Retrospective
- _antiochp:_ effort has been focused on work post emergency HF
and in parallel the secp256k1-zkp rebase

### 2. Agenda review
The agenda was accepted without changes. {tbd}

### 3. Action point follow ups from previous meetings

- fixpastfees" RFC -> FCP
 - _antiochp:_ FCP is 2 weeks and then assuming no big changes the PRs are basically ready to go immediately after that

### 4. 5.1.0 release
- _antiochp:_ the known big changes for 5.1.0 are summarized [here -](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3605) (all post HF improvements etc.)
still a little bit of work to do on cleaning up this - (https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3618)
if anyone wants to play around with it then please feel free
so 5.1.0 is still tentative, no hard deadline
but its not far off, maybe a couple of weeks (plus some testing)


### 6. Other questions
_None._


 

**Meeting adjourned.**
